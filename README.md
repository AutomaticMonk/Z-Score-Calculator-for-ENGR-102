# Z-Score-Calculator-for-ENGR-102
#This simple program calculates a z-score for a value in regards to the set it comes from and reports that value and whether the set has a normal distribution or not. 
#The design of this program is inefficient because I was required to call functions that the instructor wrote that mimic functions you can call already in Python such
#such as min() and max().
#In the futur I may replace the function calls with simple operators without the redundant function calls.
